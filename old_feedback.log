2025-01-30 15:17:30 | 129.119.235.10 | /lab-2-tooling-up | I'd suggest that you include some sort of instructions on how to make the makefile in the fist place ("use touch.. remember nano..." etc). After that everything went smoothly.

2025-02-03 15:45:07 | 129.119.235.18 | /lab-2-tooling-up | hi-ameen and chris(we're watching you work on your website during 2381)
2025-02-06 14:02:42 | 129.119.235.8 | /lab-3-moving-and-adding | My book doesn't have number, so if you could add what chapter we are supposed to read to and stop it would be really helpful. Thank you.

2025-02-13 14:37:17 | 129.119.235.21 | /lab-4-thanks-for-the-memories | Comment from Joseph: For step 9, please indicate that the students must use the debugger to find the memory address for their student ID.
2025-02-13 17:17:39 | 129.119.235.24 | /lab-3-moving-and-adding | The feedback box always pops back out when you scroll around the page.
2025-02-27 10:31:24 | 129.119.235.3 | /lab-4-thanks-for-the-memories | Step 11, the question prompt has a typo ("discuess" the differences...), but i'm nitpicking. For the most part, very good and informative! Easy to follow and understand, and I feel as though I have learned about these topics  thuroughly.  :)
2025-02-27 10:36:27 | 129.119.235.3 | /lab-4-thanks-for-the-memories | (there is also an extra *e* in "screenshot" on the prompt for step eleven, and "discuss" on step 16. Honestly though, if i didn't write my lab reports in MS word, i wouldn't have caught these, so it's not that big of a deal...)
2025-02-27 21:39:09 | 129.119.235.10 | /lab-4-thanks-for-the-memories | Step 16, last sentence, discuss is spelled "discuess"
