<div class="h-px bg-cs-green my-6"></div><h1 id="overview" class="text-4xl font-extrabold">Introduction</h1><br/>
<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">Like all physical systems, magnetic interactions are based on mathematics. Given information like distance, charge, and shape, we can calculate exactly how electromagnetic interactions should behave. However, in a much simpler environment like a videogame simulation, we can control these behaviors however we see fit. In the case of Magnet Game, I have to build the entire electromagnetic interaction system from scratch. But there's a twist. Unlike real-world systems, Magnet Game exists in discrete time and discrete space, which changes the expected behavior of magnets. I have to decide how to implement those interactions to make the environment seem intuitive to a player.</p><br/>

<div class="h-px bg-cs-green my-6"></div><h1 id="overview" class="text-4xl font-extrabold">Discrete Time</h1><br/>
<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">Discrete time means that the game is not continually updating the time. The magnets can only move and interact at certain times, and I have chosen to make that whenever the player presses a button. Take the example below of 2 magnets in an infinite loop below. Blue repels blue and attracts red (and vice versa). The green lights in the top left show when the user presses a button.</p><br/>

<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">Insert Gif 1 Here</p><br/>

<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">Even though there are times when two blue magnets sit next to each other, they do not repel until after the user's input. This is because time does not update until the instantaneous time the user presses a key. The computer then calculates where the magents should move (explained in a future post), and then teleports them to their position in the next time state.</p><br/>

<div class="h-px bg-cs-green my-6"></div><h1 id="overview" class="text-4xl font-extrabold">Discrete Space</h1><br/>
<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">Discrete space means that each object in the game can only exist in certain positions. It can be in space 1 or space 2, but not space 1.5. This is how all grid-based games work. In chess, you can't respond to e4 with d4.5. This is a very important topic for Magnet Game, because real-world systems are in continuous space and that changes greatly in discrete space (similar to how signals in DSP change when discretized). Check the gif below, which is the same as the example above, but without the animations.</p><br/>

<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">Insert Gif 2 Here</p><br/>

<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">This is how the computer sees the objects in the game, teleporting from one position to another, but not seeing anything that happens in between. Though visually in the first gif, the two magnets pass each other, they don't "connect" and start moving together as you might expect in a continuous time system. The two magnets don't even see each other.</p><br/>

<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">This also changes how forces interact in the game. In the real world, magnetic forces extend infinitely, but diminish quickly. In Magnet Game, they extend only for a certain number of discrete spaces. Small magnets only send attractive forces to cells in the four cardinal directions surrounding them. Large magnets have a 2 cell wide diamond of influence.</p><br/>

<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">In continuous space and time, you might expect something like this:</p><br/>

<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">But in Magnet Game's discretized world, this is what actually happens:</p><br/>

<div class="h-px bg-cs-green my-6"></div><h1 id="overview" class="text-4xl font-extrabold">Why Animate</h1><br/>
<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">If the animations are decpetive about how the system really works, then why include them? Why not have the visuals fully represent what is actually happening in the game? One reason. This:</p><br/>

<div class="h-px bg-cs-green my-6"></div><h1 id="overview" class="text-4xl font-extrabold">Map Code</h1><br/>
<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">As promised, here is some code you can use in your own project. It generates a map in your Godot Scene on runtime, adding all the sprites and backgrounds to the scene. This won't be plug-and-play in your project, as you will need to implement custom classes such as Matrix and Cell, but it should give you a good starting place to start implementing grid-style movement and runtime instantiation. </p><br/>
