<div class="h-px bg-cs-green my-6"></div><h1 id="overview" class="text-4xl font-extrabold">Overview</h1><br/>
<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">Welcome to the Final Project. Here, you will tie all of the topics you learned in this class together to create a couple different programs of your choosing.</p><br/>

<div class="h-px bg-cs-green my-6"></div><h1 id="grading" class="text-4xl font-extrabold">Grading</h1><br/>
<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">How this assignment will work is as follows. Below are a list of projects with assigned credits. You must choose projects that add to at least ten (10) credits. More complex projects with be rewarded with more credits. <a class="font-extrabold">These credits are NOT your final score on the assignment.</a> Your assignment will be graded like any other lab report based on explanations, code accuracy, and successful completion of each project.</p><br/>

<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">However, your grade will be weighted based on the total number of credits for the projects you choose. For example, if you only complete nine credits, then you can only receive a maximum score of 90% on the assignment. You are allowed to earn extra credit up to a 110% on the assignment (by doing at least 11 credits worth of projects). Anything over 110% is solely for your own practice and will not be counted for your final grade.</p><br/>

<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">Consider these example scores for a student who chose to do 4 projects (any number of projects is allowed):</p>
<ol class="list ml-16 text-lg"><li>- Project 1 (3 credits): 100%</li>
<li>- Project 2 (4 credits): 90%</li>
<li>- Project 3 (2 credits): 100%</li>
<li>- Project 4 (2 credits): 85%</li></ol><br/>

<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">The student did 11 total credits with a score of <code class="bg-cs-blue px-1 rounded shadow-lg text-base">(3 * 1.00) + (4 * 0.90) + (2 * 1.00) + (2 * 0.85) = 10.3; 10.3/10 = 1.03</code> and would recieve a 103 on the assignment.</p><br/>

<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">See the catalogue below for avaliable projects. Many of these come from an ancient Homework 4 for this class, which was discontinued. You will need to implement each one of these projects from scratch. <a class="font-extrabold">Any submitted code generated by a Generative AI (GenAI) like ChatGPT without proper citation will be considered a breach of the student code of conduct. Over-reliance on GenAI code will result in a heavy loss of points, even if cited appropriately.</a> You are paying to much to be here to rely on GenAI code.</p><br/>

<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">This assignment is weighted as 20% of your final grade for the lab.</p><br/>

<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">For any questions regarding the scoring on this assignment, please ask TA Cooper.</p><br/>

<div class="h-px bg-cs-green my-6"></div><h1 id="submission" class="text-4xl font-extrabold">Submission</h1><br/>
<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">Your assignment will be graded like any other lab report based on explanations, code accuracy, and successful completion of each project. Each project must have a brief (2-4 sentence) overview, text or a screenshot of all code you used, a screenshot with at least 3 unit tests to show your code works, and an explanation of how your program works in your own words. <a class="font-extrabold">You also must include your name and student ID commented somewhere in your code to receive full credit.</a></p><br/>

<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">Upon turning in your project, you must also turn in your Red Pitaya, including all attacments, and the breadboard kit from Lab 8. Failure to turn in your Pitaya will result in a 20% point deduction on this project for each day after the due date.</p><br/>

<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">The due date for this project is December 8th at 11:59 PM.</p><br/>

<div class="h-px bg-cs-green my-6"></div><h1 id="projects" class="text-4xl font-extrabold">Projects</h1><br/>
<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">16 project prompts/ideas sorted by credit value. A star <code class="bg-cs-blue px-1 rounded shadow-lg text-base">*</code> means that the project was part of the original Homework 4 (most are simplified for this project). You are also encouraged to propose your own project, seen at the bottom. Feel free to use code from previous labs (all are avaliable on the website), collaborate (each person must submit their own assignment), and ask a TA if you need assistance or clarification.</p><br/>
<div class="h-px bg-cs-green my-6"></div>
<h2 class="text-2xl text-bold underline text-cs-green">Sarcasm Generator (1 Credits)</h2>
<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">Write a program that takes a string input from the terminal and switches between capital and lowercase for every letter. Punctuation should stay the same. Examples:</p><br/>

<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">Input: "hello there"<br></p><br/>
<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">Output: "HeLlO tHeRe"</p><br/>

<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">Input: "i'm so EXCITED for this project!"<br></p><br/>
<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">Output: "I'm So ExCiTeD fOr ThIs PrOjEcT!"</p><br/>

<h2 class="text-2xl text-bold underline text-cs-green">Epples and Benenes (1 Credit)</h2>
<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">Do you know what the problem with vowels is? There's too many of them. Write a program that converts all vowels in an input into the letter "e", the best vowel. You can assume an all-lowercase input and that "y" is always a vowel. Examples:</p><br/>

<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">Input: "my favorite vowel is o."<br></p><br/>
<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">Output: "me feverete vewel es e."</p><br/>

<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">Input: "care to explain how you came up with this idea?"<br></p><br/>
<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">Output: "cere te expleen hew eee ceme ep weth thes edee?"</p><br/>

<h2 class="text-2xl text-bold underline text-cs-green">Rename a File (1 Credits)</h2>
<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">Write a program that takes 2 file names as input (one after the other). It should take all the text from the first file and move it to a new file with the second file's name. Basically, you are making a copy of a file, but with a different name. You do not need to delete the original.</p><br/>

<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">Note that this project was an extension of a lab that was dropped this semester. If you chose to do this program, let Cooper know and he will upload the removed lab for reference.</p><br/>
<div class="h-px bg-cs-green my-6"></div>
<h2 class="text-2xl text-bold underline text-cs-green">Upgraded Sine Look Up Table (2 Credits)*</h2>
<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">Convert the Sine Lookup Table from Example 12.1 in your book from 90 degrees to 180 degrees. This can be done by strategically <a class="italic">reducing</a> the amount of code from the code given. You can find working copies/code-given of Example 12.1 and an updated sine table <a href="https://github.com/cshapard26/CoopShapWebsite/blob/main/markdown/Labs1181/FinalProject/SineLookup.md" class="text-lg text-cs-blue hover:text-blue-700 underline">here</a>.</p><br/>

<h2 class="text-2xl text-bold underline text-cs-green">Palindrome Identifier (2 Credits)</h2>
<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">Write a program that takes an input from the terminal and outputs whether the entered word is a palindrome (spelled the same way forward and backwards). You can assume that the input is always alphabetic and lowercase. Examples:</p><br/>

<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">Input: "racecar"<br></p><br/>
<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">Output: "Palindrome" or "True" or "1" (any of these work)</p><br/>

<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">Input: "cooper"<br></p><br/>
<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">Output: "Not a Palindrome" or "False" or "0" (any of these work)</p><br/>

<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">Input: "palindromeemordnilap"<br></p><br/>
<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">Output: "Palindrome" or "True" or "1" (any of these work)</p><br/>


<h2 class="text-2xl text-bold underline text-cs-green">Factorial Calculator (2 Credits)*</h2>
<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">Write a program that takes a 1 digit number as input from the terminal and calculates the factorial (!). Remember that a factorial, n!, is calculated as (n * n-1 * n-2 ... * 2 * 1). This should be done through a loop and not brute forced. Note that there is a multiplication command in ARM (it is MUL, and you use it just like an ADD or SUB). Though the input needs to be from the terminal, you can view the output in the debugger. Examples:</p><br/>

<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">Input: "5"<br></p><br/>
<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">Output: (gdb) value in R6 is 0x78, or 120 in decimal</p><br/>

<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">Input: "9"<br></p><br/>
<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">Output: (gdb) value in R6 is 0x58980, or 362880 in decimal</p><br/>


<h2 class="text-2xl text-bold underline text-cs-green">Caesar Cipher (2 Credits)</h2>
<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">Write a program that takes a string and a number as inputs (one after the other) and shifts all letters by the given amount. This creates a classic Caesar Cipher. You can assume that the input is always lowercase and alphabetic and that the number is always a single-digit positive integer. Examples:</p><br/>

<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">Input: "cooper<br></p><br/>
<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">        2      "<br></p><br/>
<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">Output: "eqqrgt"</p><br/>

<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">Input: "a secret message<br></p><br/>
<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">        9                "<br></p><br/>
<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">Output: "j bnlanc vnbbjpn"</p><br/>
<div class="h-px bg-cs-green my-6"></div><h2 class="text-2xl text-bold underline text-cs-green">Binary Search (3 Credits)*</h2>
<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">You are given a pre-sorted list of elements. Write a program that uses binary search to find a given element. You do not need to take input from the terminal (all searching can be hard coded and shown in the debugger). You can find the sorted list/code given <a href="https://github.com/cshapard26/CoopShapWebsite/blob/main/markdown/Labs1181/FinalProject/BinarySearch.md" class="text-lg text-cs-blue hover:text-blue-700 underline">here</a></p><br/>


<h2 class="text-2xl text-bold underline text-cs-green">Blinking Lights v2.0 (3 Credits)</h2>
<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">Change the code from Lab 8 to support up to 5 lights. The code must be algorithmic (you cannot hard code each number). In theory, your program should be able to support up to 32 lights with very few changes. More supplies are avaliable upon request.</p><br/>

<h2 class="text-2xl text-bold underline text-cs-green">Division/Modulus Operator (3 Credits)</h2>
<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">Implement a macro that divides two numbers. It should return the whole-number quotient in R6 and the remainder (% or Modulus) in R7. You cannot use the division commands or functions already present in ARM. You do not need to take input or output from the terminal. The code should work by hard-coding 2 numbers into R0 and R1 which are your dividend and divisor, respectively. You can view the output in the debugger.</p><br/>

<h2 class="text-2xl text-bold underline text-cs-green">Bubble Sort (3 Credits)*</h2>
<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">You are given a randomized series of numbers, which can be found <a href="https://github.com/cshapard26/CoopShapWebsite/blob/main/markdown/Labs1181/FinalProject/BubbleSort.md" class="text-lg text-cs-blue hover:text-blue-700 underline">here</a>. Write a program that sorts the numbers using the bubble sort algoritm. You can check that you program works using the debugger to view memory, where the sorted elements should be stored. Here is a C version of the algorithm to use as pseudocode:</p><br/>

<pre class="dark:bg-gray-600 bg-gray-400 rounded-lg p-4 shadow-2xl overflow-auto">
last = num;
while (last > 0) {
    pairs = last – 1;
    for (j = 0; j <= pairs; j++) {
        if (entry[j] > entry [j+1]) {
            temp = entry[j];
            entry[j] = entry[j+1];
            entry[j+1] = temp;
            last = j;
        }
    }
}</pre>

<div class="h-px bg-cs-green my-6"></div>
<h2 class="text-2xl text-bold underline text-cs-green">64-bit Multiplication (4 Credits)</h2>
<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">Create a macro that expands ARM's 32-bit multiplication to allow an answer of up to 64 bits. It should return the product split between 2 registers (as in, R6 has bits 63-32 and R7 has bits 31-0). You cannot use the built in ARM functionality for this (but you can use the standard 32-bit MUL command if needed). You do not need to take input or output from the terminal. You can view the output in the debugger.</p><br/>

<h2 class="text-2xl text-bold underline text-cs-green">Text-based Video Game (4 Credits)</h2>
<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">Create a text-based video game in ARM. The game should have the following minimum criterion:</p>
<ol class="list ml-16 text-lg"><li>- A nameable character whose name appears in at least 2 different spots within the game</li>
<li>- At least 6 Y/N or choice-based decisions/actions. Actions must have a meaningful effect on gameplay</li>
<li>- A health system (does not have to be fighting health, could be a strike system for making mistakes, etc.)</li>
<li>- The ability to quit the game from within the game (as in, end the program without needing to Ctrl+C).</li></ol>
<div class="h-px bg-cs-green my-6"></div>
<h2 class="text-2xl text-bold underline text-cs-green">Decimal to Ascii Coverter (5 Credits)</h2>
<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">This is a big one. For all the other projects that say "you don't need to print this to the terminal, just show it in the debugger", they say that because ascii and decimal don't blend well and you can't stdout/print a decimal number without converting to ascii. Your goal is to write a program/macro that takes numeric ASCII input from the terminal and converts it into an integer/number to be stored in memory. It then must be able to turn the number into an ASCII representation of the decimal number and print it out. You cannot take each digit as a separate input ("1 2 3 4"). It has to be continuous ("1234").</p><br/>

<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">Thus, you should have this process:</p><br/>
<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">Input: "1234"</p>
<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">Memory: 1234 or 0x4d2</p>
<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">Output: "1234"</p><br/>

<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">To prove your program works, input a 5 digit number, LSL it by 2 bits, and then print out the resulting number to the terminal. Examples:</p><br/>

<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">Input: "39082"<br></p>
<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">In Memory: 0x98aa</p>

<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">Output: "156328"</p><br/>


<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">Input: "1213141"<br></p>
<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">In Memory: 0x1282d5</p>

<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">Output: "4852564"</p><br/>

<h2 class="text-2xl text-bold underline text-cs-green">Happy Birthday (5 Credits)</h2>
<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">Play the song Happy Birthday on the breadboard using code from the Red Pitaya. Supplies avaliable upon request.</p><br/>
<div class="h-px bg-cs-green my-6"></div>
<h2 class="text-2xl text-bold underline text-cs-green">Create your own! (1 - 8 Credits)</h2>
<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">Propose your idea and have it credited by TA Cooper! Highly encouraged for at least one of your projects (show us your creativity).</p><br/>
