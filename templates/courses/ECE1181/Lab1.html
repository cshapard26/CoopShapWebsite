<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">Welcome back to the Microcontrollers lab. In this lab, we are going to look at ARM Assembly code, how it works, how to compile it, and make some light modifications. </p><br/>

<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">All labs require a lab report. For a comprehensive look on what the TAs are looking for, formatting, and scoring, take a look at the <a href="lab-guide" class="text-lg text-cs-blue hover:text-blue-700 underline">Lab Report Guide</a>.</p><br/>

<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">These lab guides are handmade, and as such may contain errors in logic, spelling, grammar, etc. If you find any issues, please leave a note in the Feedback tab on the right so we can fix it ASAP.</p><br/>

<div class="h-px bg-cs-green my-6"></div><h1 id="phil" class="text-4xl font-extrabold">The ARM Philosophy</h1><br/>
<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">The purpose of ARM is to write machine-level commands for microcontrollers with ARM architectures (a very large chunk of modern computers). This type of code is often called "low level," where the level is referring to how close you are to just coding in straight binary. ARM is one level above that. By coding in the ARM Assembly Language, you are doing the closest human-feasible thing to coding in raw binary 1's and 0's. </p><br/>

<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">The main philosophy of how ARM Assembly works is this: few commands, and each do exactly one thing at a time. You are trying to make a program with the smallest possible units.</p><br/>

<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">If you have programming experience in any language, this might be unintuitive (if you don't have programming experience, don't worry. After this class, you will get to brag that your first language was Assembly). The goal of most languages is to pack as much computation, logic, or decision-making possible into a single statement. That's what if-statements, loops, and lists/arrays are for. ARM doesn't have any of those, they make you do it from scratch.</p><br/>

<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">But why? Why learn ARM if it is just making everything more complicated, takes longer to code, and has less functionality than literally every other programming language? To that, I respond: good point. You will probably never be asked to write assembly code in real life (unless you go into specific fields like computer architecture). But that's not the point. The point is learning how computers operate at the most fundamental level. 1's and 0's don't get the luxury of if-statements or loops. Logic gates don't know what a string is. The point is to understand how these machines think, how to talk with them, and how to use them at maximum performance.</p><br/>

<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">The computer that you are using probably has at least 8 GB of RAM. That is an objective buttload of memory available to you. You can write a Python program however you want, and the code itself is not going to make a dent in that. Real microcontrollers, the ones that run all devices from coffee machines to game controllers to speakers to pace-makers? Top dollar ones will give you less than 10 MB. The ones you will be working with will be in the 10's of KB or less. Kilobytes. You get 10,000 bytes to work with. That's it. The standard python package with no libraries is 232,000,000 bytes (232 MB). </p><br/>

<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">As you may be starting to see, ARM Assembly makes a lot more sense in the context of actual microcontrollers. You goal is to make a program as small as possible, as fast as possible, as optimized as possible. You cannot get that level of sheer performance with any other language (even Rust, don't even go there). With ARM, you are only paying memory for <a class="italic">exactly</a> what you need to compute. No more, no less. That is the ARM philosophy.</p><br/>

<div class="h-px bg-cs-green my-6"></div><h1 id="arm" class="text-4xl font-extrabold">ARM Code</h1><br/>
<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">ARM code (which is what I will be calling ARM Assembly of the ARM7TDMI variant) is based around 4 main commands: MOVE, ADD, LOAD, STORE, as well as variations of these. You will learn how to use each of these commands in future labs. What makes ARM better than other assembly languages is that it offers lots of other commands without any performance costs.</p><br/>

<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">Here is an example of a basic script you might see in ARM:</p><br/>
            <pre class="dark:bg-gray-600 bg-gray-400 rounded-lg p-4 shadow-2xl overflow-auto">
.global _start

_start:
    MOV R0, #1              @ Command type
    LDR R1, =helloworld     @ String to print
    MOV R2, #13             @ String length
    MOV R7, #4              @ System call type
    SVC 0                   @ Execute command 

    MOV R0, #0
    MOV R7, #1
    SVC 0

.data
    helloworld: .ascii "Hello World!\n"</pre>
            
    <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">This code prints "Hello World!" to your terminal when run.</p><br/>

    <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">A couple things to note before we dive in to what each line means:</p><br/>
    <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">    1. The commands are all case insensitive. <code class="bg-cs-blue px-1 rounded shadow-lg text-base">MOV</code> is the same as <code class="bg-cs-blue px-1 rounded shadow-lg text-base">mov</code> is the same as <code class="bg-cs-blue px-1 rounded shadow-lg text-base">Mov</code> (<code class="bg-cs-blue px-1 rounded shadow-lg text-base">r1</code> == <code class="bg-cs-blue px-1 rounded shadow-lg text-base">R1</code>, <code class="bg-cs-blue px-1 rounded shadow-lg text-base">ldR</code> == <code class="bg-cs-blue px-1 rounded shadow-lg text-base">lDr</code>, etc). You can use whichever you prefer in your own code, but I will default to using all caps in the examples given.</p><br/>
    <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">    2. As with all programming languages, ARM supports comments. These are designated by the <code class="bg-cs-blue px-1 rounded shadow-lg text-base">@</code> symbol, and anything after it is ignored by the program. These are just used for you to document your thoughts, or for me to explain what things do (in future labs, where I won't be explaining every line). The spacing between comments and code is not required, but I will default to lining up the comments so they are easier to read.</p><br/>
    <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">    3. The tabs before the commands are optional. In general, ARM ignores all whitespace (i.e. you can put as many spaces between text as you want, indent wherever, etc).</p><br/>
    
    <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">You are not expected to know or fully understand what all this code does in this lab alone. You will be working with ARM a lot moving forwards, and the more you work with it, the better you will get and the more you will understand. In fact, the program given is quite complex for an introduction. The reason we are using it is because it gives you a visual indicator that things are working (by printing to the terminal). </p><br/>
    
    <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">Here is the play-by-play for this program:</p><br/>
    <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">    1. <code class="bg-cs-blue px-1 rounded shadow-lg text-base">.global _start</code></p>
    <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">    Tells the computer that your program begins at the address associated with <code class="bg-cs-blue px-1 rounded shadow-lg text-base">_start</code>. Remember how I said that you only get around 10,000 bytes on a standard microcontroller? Your program doesn't start on the first byte. It will probably get stored somewhere around byte 6,000. The computer needs to know where your program starts, and the "_start" keyword is used to tell it that. Anything in ARM that starts with a <code class="bg-cs-blue px-1 rounded shadow-lg text-base">.</code> is called a "directive" and is used for giving the system context. <code class="bg-cs-blue px-1 rounded shadow-lg text-base">.global</code> means that <a class="italic">this</a> "_start" should be used as the starting point for all programs (makes more sense when you realize you can have multiple ARM files working together).</p><br/>
    <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">    2. <code class="bg-cs-blue px-1 rounded shadow-lg text-base">_start:</code></p>
    <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">    As mentioned above, "_start" is where you program begins.</p><br/>
    <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">    3. <code class="bg-cs-blue px-1 rounded shadow-lg text-base">MOV R0, #1</code></p>
    <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">    This can be read as "Move, into R0, the value 1". You should have seen what registers are from lecture, but they are essentially your "variables" in ARM. You get 12 of them total. If you need more, you have to overwrite old ones. Each register holds 32 bits of data. Here, we are saying "replace whatever value is in register 0 with the number 1". After this command executes, R0 will hold the hex number 0x1. You will learn more about MOV commands in the next lab.</p><br/>
    <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">    4. <code class="bg-cs-blue px-1 rounded shadow-lg text-base">LDR R1, =helloworld</code></p>
    <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">    This can be read as "Load, into register 1, the memory address of the <code class="bg-cs-blue px-1 rounded shadow-lg text-base">helloworld</code> tag." Similar to MOV instructions, LDR (load) instructions replace the value of a register with a new one. The difference is that they go through memory (you will see this more in future labs). The <code class="bg-cs-blue px-1 rounded shadow-lg text-base">=</code> sign means "find this tag". "Tag" is what I will be calling lines that start with something + a colon (:). <code class="bg-cs-blue px-1 rounded shadow-lg text-base">_start:</code> and <code class="bg-cs-blue px-1 rounded shadow-lg text-base">helloworld:</code> are two tags in this program. Tags are used to mark a memory address (you will learn about these in future labs). So, what this command is doing is finding the memory address associated with the tag <code class="bg-cs-blue px-1 rounded shadow-lg text-base">helloworld</code> and putting that address in R1 (register 1).</p><br/>
    <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">    5. <code class="bg-cs-blue px-1 rounded shadow-lg text-base">MOV R2, #13</code></p>
    <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">    Another move command, works the same as line 3. This one moves the value 13 (0xD in hex) into register 2.</p><br/>
    <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">    6. <code class="bg-cs-blue px-1 rounded shadow-lg text-base">MOV R7, #4</code></p>
    <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">    This one is left as an exercise for the reader.</p><br/>
    <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">    7. <code class="bg-cs-blue px-1 rounded shadow-lg text-base">SVC 0</code></p>
    <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">    This is a command that executes some sort of system-wide protocol. In this lab, you will see this be used to execute Linux commands from inside ARM code. To use <code class="bg-cs-blue px-1 rounded shadow-lg text-base">SVC 0</code>, you need to add some configuration to it. This configuration is stored in registers 0 through 7. The content in these registers tells the SVC what to execute and how to execute it. We will go over this configuration more in a second. Just know that, once the program reaches an <code class="bg-cs-blue px-1 rounded shadow-lg text-base">SVC</code> command, it will execute whatever system call it is configured to do.</p><br/>
    <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">    8-10.</p>
    <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">    More <code class="bg-cs-blue px-1 rounded shadow-lg text-base">MOV</code>s which configure another system call, then executed at the <code class="bg-cs-blue px-1 rounded shadow-lg text-base">SVC 0</code>.</p><br/>
    <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">    11. <code class="bg-cs-blue px-1 rounded shadow-lg text-base">.data</code></p>
    <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">    This is another directive, which is used to mark where program ends and user-defined memory begins. In this section, you cannot execute commands, but you can store large quantities of data. Generally, data in this section will follow the pattern <code class="bg-cs-blue px-1 rounded shadow-lg text-base">tag: directive content</code>. Where the tag marks the memory address, the directive tells the system what type of data is stored there, and the content is, well, the content. The <code class="bg-cs-blue px-1 rounded shadow-lg text-base">.data</code> section will continue until another section is declared using a directive or the system runs out of assigned memory.</p><br/>
    <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">    12. <code class="bg-cs-blue px-1 rounded shadow-lg text-base">helloworld: .ascii "Hello World!\n"</code></p>
    <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">    Using the .data pattern listed above, this data packet is structured the same. <code class="bg-cs-blue px-1 rounded shadow-lg text-base">helloworld:</code> is the tag. You can use whatever name you want for a tag. The only restriction is that you can't use any text that is already reserved by ARM (i.e. directives, commands like MOV, etc). Tags <a class="italic">are</a> case-sensitive, so <code class="bg-cs-blue px-1 rounded shadow-lg text-base">helloworld:</code> is a different tag than <code class="bg-cs-blue px-1 rounded shadow-lg text-base">HelloWorld:</code>. <code class="bg-cs-blue px-1 rounded shadow-lg text-base">.ascii</code> is the directive which states that the following data is of type ASCII (meaning it is human-readable text). And finally, <code class="bg-cs-blue px-1 rounded shadow-lg text-base">"Hello World!\n"</code> is the data being held here. You may wonder what the "\n" is for. That is the ASCII character for a newline. When printed in the terminal, it will create a new line (essentially what happens when you click "enter" while typing in a text program). This is mostly just used for formatting, but can have some other benefits you will learn later. Note that, while "\n" is composed of two actual characters ("\" and "n"), ASCII/ARM read it as a single character. When counting how many characters are in a string, you should only count "\n" as a single character.</p><br/>
    
    <div class="h-px bg-cs-green my-6"></div><h1 id="comp" class="text-4xl font-extrabold">What is Compiling</h1><br/>
    <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">Above, you can see how ARM code works, but how does a computer understand it? As you probably know, computers only speak binary. They only understand 1's and 0's. We need some sort of translator to change our human-readable code into machine code. This translator is known as a compiler, and the act of translating the code is called compiling. Luckily, some really smart people designed most of the world's compilers back before you were born. It is a hard challenge and is outside the scope of this class (talk to Cooper if you're interested, though. He can get you more info). </p><br/>
    
    <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">However, unlike other coding languages, Assembly is only one step above binary, which means every input you type is 1-to-1 converted to binary. For example, <code class="bg-cs-blue px-1 rounded shadow-lg text-base">MOV</code> is converted directly to <code class="bg-cs-blue px-1 rounded shadow-lg text-base">1101</code>. In this way, everything you type is just simplified binary, so if you know ARM and have the Instruction to Binary dictionary, then you could quite literally code in binary. Quite impressive.</p><br/>
    
    <div class="h-px bg-cs-green my-6"></div><h1 id="overview" class="text-4xl font-extrabold">Makefile</h1><br/>
    <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">There are many compilers out there, but in this class we will use <code class="bg-cs-blue px-1 rounded shadow-lg text-base">make</code>. Here is the <code class="bg-cs-blue px-1 rounded shadow-lg text-base">makefile</code> we will use in this lab:</p><br/>    
            <pre class="dark:bg-gray-600 bg-gray-400 rounded-lg p-4 shadow-2xl overflow-auto">
SRC = filename.s


OBJS = $(SRC:.s=.o)
EXEC = $(SRC:.s=)

ifdef DEBUG
DEBUGFLGS = -g
else
DEBUGFLGS =
endif

%.o : %.s
    as $(DEBUGFLGS) $< -o $@

$(EXEC): $(OBJS)
    ld -o $(EXEC) $(OBJS)</pre>
            
    <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">You should take this code and put it in a file named <code class="bg-cs-blue px-1 rounded shadow-lg text-base">makefile</code>, exactly like that. No file extension. IMPORTANT: Make sure the lines that start with <code class="bg-cs-blue px-1 rounded shadow-lg text-base">as</code> and <code class="bg-cs-blue px-1 rounded shadow-lg text-base">ld</code> have a TAB in front of them. Sometimes copy-pasting will change them to spaces, which will break the file.</p><br/>

    <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">You will use this file for every lab from now on, so be sure to keep it in a safe place. This is not code you need to memorize or understand, and what is going on here is outside the scope of this lab. Just know this compiles your program.</p><br/>
    
    <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">To use this file, make sure to have your ARM code in a file with the extension <code class="bg-cs-blue px-1 rounded shadow-lg text-base">.s</code>. Then, <code class="bg-cs-blue px-1 rounded shadow-lg text-base">nano</code> into the makefile and change the first line from <code class="bg-cs-blue px-1 rounded shadow-lg text-base">filename.s</code> to the actual name of your file, with the extension. Then, exit nano. Now your makefile is primed to compile the specific file you listed.</p><br/>
    
    <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">To actually compile the file, run the Linux command <code class="bg-cs-blue px-1 rounded shadow-lg text-base">make</code>. IMPORTANT: You need to run <code class="bg-cs-blue px-1 rounded shadow-lg text-base">make</code> after EVERY TIME you change your code. You are only changing the .s file, so to update the executable, you need to compile the updated .s file again. </p><br/>
    
    <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">Go ahead and take the code from the ARM Code section and put it into a new file ending in <code class="bg-cs-blue px-1 rounded shadow-lg text-base">.s</code>. Then, try to <code class="bg-cs-blue px-1 rounded shadow-lg text-base">make</code> the file and be sure everything works smoothly. If you list the files in your current directory (remember that command?), you will see two new files: one that has the same name as your code file but ending in <code class="bg-cs-blue px-1 rounded shadow-lg text-base">.o</code> (called an Object file), and one without an extension (called an Executable). The executable is the file that your computer can actually understand and run.</p><br/>
    
    
    <div class="h-px bg-cs-green my-6"></div><h1 id="run" class="text-4xl font-extrabold">Running the Code</h1><br/>
    <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">Now that you have made the executable, you need to actually run it. To run any file in the terminal, you type <code class="bg-cs-blue px-1 rounded shadow-lg text-base">./filename</code>, where filename is the name of the executable you are running. Make sure to do <code class="bg-cs-blue px-1 rounded shadow-lg text-base">filename</code> and not <code class="bg-cs-blue px-1 rounded shadow-lg text-base">filename.s</code> or <code class="bg-cs-blue px-1 rounded shadow-lg text-base">filename.o</code>. Try running your code now, and make sure it prints "Hello World!" to the screen and formats it nicely.</p><br/>
    
    <div class="h-px bg-cs-green my-6"></div><h1 id="conclusion" class="text-4xl font-extrabold">Conclusion</h1><br/>
    <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">Congratulations! You now know the basics of ARM code and how to get it running. It may take a minute to settle into these concepts, but know that there are plenty of resources available to you if you are confused. See either Dr. Kinnaird's office hours or preferably the TA office hours for help with labs, homework, or general questions about the course. All that's left to do now is to write your lab report and submit it via Canvas sometime before your next lab session.</p><br/>
    
    <div class="h-px bg-cs-green my-6"></div><h1 id="assignment" class="text-4xl font-extrabold">Assignment</h1><br/>
    <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">The assignment portion of the lab contains all instructions and requirements for your lab report. Any challenges or questions in the sections above were hypothetical and just for your practice. On your lab report, you only need to respond to the assignments in this section. Remember that you can check out the <a href="lab-guide" class="text-lg text-cs-blue hover:text-blue-700 underline">Lab Report Guide</a> to see the expectations the TAs have of your lab reports. Without further ado, here is your task:</p><br/>
    
    <h2 class="text-2xl text-bold underline text-cs-green">Task 1</h2>
<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">Write a program that prints "Hello, Your Name Here!", replacing "Your Name Here" with your full name.</p><br/>

<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">Additional Requirements:</p>
<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">- You must show the process of compiling and running the code in your screenshot.</p><br/>

<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">Assumptions:</p>
<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">- You only need to modify the code given previously in the ARM Code section of this lab guide.</p><br/>
