<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">Welcome to ECE1181, here is a quick message on how to write a lab report and what the TAs are looking for in your responses. Here is the general structure of a lab report.</p>

<div class="h-px bg-cs-green my-6"></div><h1 id="overview" class="text-4xl font-extrabold">Structure</h1><br/>
<h2 class="text-2xl text-bold underline text-cs-green">Header</h2>
<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">At the top of your document, include your name, SMUID, and lab section (Monday or Wednesday). Also specify which lab you are reporting as the title of your document.</p><br/>

<h2 class="text-2xl text-bold underline text-cs-green">Overview</h2>
<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">Write a couple sentences on what you are doing, what the assignment is, and how you solved it. This should be written so that somebody who is not in the class (but is familiar with the subject) can quickly read over it and see what you are doing. Don't go into details in this section. This is also a great place to provide feedback on specific things you did not understand in the lab so that the TAs can adjust the course to help you learn better.</p><br/>

<h2 class="text-2xl text-bold underline text-cs-green">Responses</h2>
<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">This is the part where you will respond to the questions/tasks specified in the lab guide. Please divide and label the sections by task number. In Pick 2 labs, remember to specifiy which two tasks you are attempting.</p><br/>

<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">Your response should fully cover the given prompt with enough detail to prove you have a reasonable understanding of the question and your answer. These should be IN YOUR OWN WORDS. You are welcome to use AI to assist your learning, but you cannot use it to write your lab report, and points will be deducted for doing so. This is similar to the actual research world, where AI is used to assist in experiments, but AI written research papers are either not accepted or publically ridiculed (anyone seen the pregnant mouse diagram?).</p><br/>

<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">If your responses include code you write, you must include it in the lab report alongside the description. Note that a screenshot of your code is almost never enough to fully answer the prompt, and some description about what is happening in your screenshot is required. IMPORTANT: Code comments are for you, the lab report is for the TAs. Having a bunch of comments in your code is not a suitable replacement for a description in your lab report, and your code comments will largely be ignored by the TAs when grading (unless referenced by your description, etc).</p><br/>

<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">Include screenshots where necessary. Use as many as it takes to show everything you need.</p><br/>

<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">Also, if you are running code for your task, make sure to include at least two test cases for your code (if applicable). If your code is asking you to compute a factorial, don't just include the code and call it a day. Also include at least two examples of your code actually working (plug in 3 and show that it outputs 6, plug in 7 and show that it outputs 5040, etc).</p><br/>

<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">Format things nicely and make sure it is easy to know what you are talking about. Saying something is on line 44 of your code and not including line numbers is torture for the TAs. If something is unreadable, if a screenshot is compressed to oblivion, or if the TA is unable to comprehend your lab report, they may ask for a resubmission.</p><br/>

<h2 class="text-2xl text-bold underline text-cs-green">Conclusion</h2>
<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">Write 1-2 sentences just wrapping up what you did and if your responses worked or not. You still may be awarded credit for a worthwhile attempt even if your code does not work as intended. Explaining WHY code didn't work in the conclusion will always get you credit back.</p><br/>

<h2 class="text-2xl text-bold underline text-cs-green">References</h2>
<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">If you use any outside references during any point of your lab (this includes Generative AI like GPT), you must include a cited reference to the source material at the bottom of your lab report. Failure to do so will be considered academic dishonesty and will result in heavy loss of points and/or referall to the Student Conduct Office.</p><br/>

<div class="h-px bg-cs-green my-6"></div><h1 id="overview" class="text-4xl font-extrabold">Grading</h1><br/>
<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">The grading scale is as such:</p><br/>

<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">Labs are worth 80% of the grade and your final project is worth 20%. There are 8 labs, so each lab is worth 10% of your grade. Grades are for the one credit lab section and do not affect your class grade.</p><br/>

<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">For each lab report, the overview is worth 20%, the reponses to the questions are worth 30%, and the code you write is worth 50% (if the lab asks for code).</p><br/>

<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">Late penalty without prior communication is 25% per week. Any labs not turned in before the final day of class will recieve a 0%.</p><br/>

<div class="h-px bg-cs-green my-6"></div><h1 id="overview" class="text-4xl font-extrabold">Schedule</h1><br/>
<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">Lab reports are due before the next lab starts. If you are in Monday lab, you need to turn in the lab before next Monday. If we don't have lab next Monday, you will have 2 weeks to complete the lab. TAs will try and get grades in within a week of the due date, but remember that we are students too and sometimes class can push back that 1-week goal.</p><br/>

<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">Due dates are flexible, but only if you let us know in advance. Need an extention? 9 out of 10 times it will be approved, but only if you tell us before the due date of the lab. Be proactive in your requests so we can help you best!</p><br/>

<div class="h-px bg-cs-green my-6"></div><h1 id="overview" class="text-4xl font-extrabold">Final Thoughts</h1><br/>
<p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">Let a TA know if you have any questions!</p><br/>
