                    Right now, everything may seem like a jumble of letters, commands, and confusing sequences, but the Command Line is made to be logical. You don't need to memorize everything. In fact, **you will only need to know about 5-6 commands to be successful in most classes.** Any additional commands will probably need to be looked up in the moment, as many have very specific input parameters.

                <h1 class="text-2xl text-bold underline text-cs-green">Physical Setup</h1>
                <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">
                    For the physical red pitaya, make sure you have done these things:
                </p>
                <br/>
                <ol class="list-decimal ml-16 text-lg">
                    <li>Place the microSD card into the slot, if it is not already in there.</li>
                    <li>Plug the ethernet cable from the pitaya to your computer (we will be passing out adapters at the beginning of the lab)</li>
                    <li>Provide power to the board with the microUSB port. There are 2 ports, so make sure you are using the PWR one (the one on the right).</li>
                </ol>
                <br/>
                <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">
                    If you have completed these steps, you should see the light on the pitaya blinking green and occasionally red. This is normal.
                </p> 
                <br/>
                <h1 class="text-2xl text-bold underline text-cs-green">Virtual Setup</h1>
                <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">
                    Now that your pitaya is all connected, we can make sure it is working digitally. To make sure you are connected properly, visit <code class="bg-cs-blue px-1 rounded shadow-lg text-base">http://rp-xxxxxx.local</code>  (replace the x's with the six digits on your red pitaya. It will be on your case, or the sticker with the QR code if the other one fell off). If you are connected properly, you should be brought to a website with a Red Pitaya logo in the background and some buttons. If the website times out, then something went wrong. See below for some troubleshooting tips.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <h1 class="text-2xl text-bold underline text-cs-green">Troubleshooting</h1>
                <ol class="list-decimal ml-6 text-lg">
                    <li>Double check the website name. It is case insensitive. You may also need to add a "/" at the end to connect (i.e. http://rp-xxxxxx.local/), but try it with and without the slash.</li>
                    <li>If you are using a VPN, you may need to disconnect from it to interact with the red pitaya.</li>
                    <li>Try flipping around the ethernet cord and/or the adapter. If you have a nearby friend who's device is working, try using their adapter and see if that is the issue.</li>
                    <li>If none of the above works, contact the nearest TA for assistance.</li>
                </ol>
                <br/>
                <h1 class="text-2xl text-bold underline text-cs-green">Connecting and Editing</h1>
                <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">
                    To edit and create files on your red pitaya, we will be using something called Nano (or vim, if you choose to use that). We used to use VSCode to manage files on the pitaya, but recent updates have presented interfacing issues. Nano is also a good skill to learn, so consider it part of your learning experience.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">
                    If you are new to the terminal (which I expect most of you to be), I <b><u>highly</u></b> suggest you read through my <a href="/courses/conquering-the-terminal" class="text-lg text-cs-blue hover:text-blue-700 underline">Conquering the Terminal</a> guide. It is a short read and will teach you the basics of using the terminal and the 7 commands that you will need to be able to use in this class.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <ol class="list-decimal ml-6 text-lg space-y-2">
                    <li>Open "Terminal" if you are on Mac and "Powershell" if you are on Windows.</li>
                    <li>When it opens, type <code class="bg-cs-blue px-1 rounded shadow-lg text-base">ssh root@rp-xxxxxx.local</code> where "xxxxxx" is your pitaya number, and click enter.</li>
                    <li>It should prompt you for a password. It is <code class="bg-cs-blue0 px-1 rounded text-base">root</code>. <u> You won't see the letters you are typing in the command line. This is normal. Just type "root" and click enter.</u></li>
                    <li>You should now be connected to your red pitaya (you can check this by seeing what the beginning of the line in the terminal says. It should say "root:~ $" or something similar instead of your laptop name).</li>
                    <li>To create a file, type <code class="bg-cs-blue px-1 rounded shadow-lg text-base">touch main.s</code>. This creates a file called "main.s" in the current directory (a.k.a folder).</li>
                    <li>Type <code class="bg-cs-blue px-1 rounded shadow-lg text-base">nano main.s</code> to start editing an empty file named main.s. This is the Nano window. It is VERY confusing, even to experienced users. Here is a general overview of what you need to know:</li>
                </ol>
                <br/>
                <ol class="list-decimal ml-16 text-lg leading-relaxed space-y-2">
                    <li>You can type to enter text into a file and delete with the backspace key just like in a text editor.</li>
                    
                    <li>Some helpful commands are listed at the bottom. The "M-" means 'modifier', which varies depending on Mac vs Windows. I believe you can also hold down ESC and press the listed key for M- commands. You can also look up Nano commands if there is something specific you want to do.</li>
                    <li>You cannot use your mouse to select an area or move your cursor. You need to use arrow keys to move around.</li>
                    <li> To save, press Control+O (it is still Control on Mac, not Command). It will ask you for a file name, which should be filled as 'main.s' from your previous command. </li>
                    <li> When you are done editing, press Control+X to exit the editor. It may ask if you want to "save the modified buffer", which just means Save. Click Y to save.</li>
                    <li>Nano can be very confusing and overwhelming. If you get stuck or have questions, ask a TA. </li>
                </ol>
                <br/>
                <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">
                    This should be everything you need to know to setup the Red Pitaya. If you encounter difficulty at any step, let the nearest TA know and we can help you through the process. <b>For the first lab, we will be prioritizing getting people's pitayas working. Please be patient if you have a coding question, as hardware errors are our primary concern.</b>

                    Welcome to Lab 1! Here, you will learn how to set up your red pitaya, connect to it using your laptop, and start writing some code. Luckily for you, this year all the red-pitayas will be given to you pre-assembled, which cuts down on the time-commitment of this lab.
                </p>

                    This is out first semester using this website as a replacement for an pdf lab document (we made this update after 100% of previous students said they prefer the website instructions over the pdf). If you find any errors in this guide—whether logic, spelling, or grammar—please let TA Cooper know so he can get it fixed up ASAP. Expect new features to be added to this site in upcoming labs.

                <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">
                    For this lab, you will need "Raspberry Pi Assembly Language Programming by Stephen Smith" (referred to as the "Smith book"), which is required for this class. You need a copy of the book, either digital or physical. You can get the book for free on Pearson if you log in with your SMU email.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">
                    Now, read through chapter 1. You can skim until page 17, where you will be getting instructions for this lab.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <h1 class="text-2xl text-bold underline text-cs-green">Step 1</h1>
                <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg italic">
                    Code from the book can be found in the <a href="#code-given" class="text-lg text-cs-blue hover:text-blue-700 underline">Code Given</a> section at the bottom of this guide.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">
                    Type the code from the book into a new file called "HelloWorld.s" using Nano, as described above. Next, add the two lines from the book/Code Given into a file called "build". It should NOT have a filetype (i.e. .txt, .s, etc.). You can check to make sure all the files were created properly by typing <code class="bg-cs-blue px-1 rounded shadow-lg text-base">ls</code> into the terminal. This will list all the files in the current folder on your Red Pitaya. If you don't see "HelloWorld.s" and "build", ask a TA for assistance.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">
                    In your terminal (not in the Nano editor) type this command: <code class="bg-cs-blue px-1 rounded shadow-lg text-base">chmod +x build</code>. This command basically just tells the computer to transform the file "build" into an executeable, or a file the computer can run. We can finally start executeing some code. 
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">
                    To compile your code, run <code class="bg-cs-blue px-1 rounded shadow-lg text-base">./build</code> in your terminal. This with create a new file called "HelloWorld" (namely different than "HelloWorld.s"). This is the code your computer can run. To run it, type <code class="bg-cs-blue px-1 rounded shadow-lg text-base">./HelloWorld</code> into your terminal. This should output the phrase "Hello World!" in the next line of your terminal. If it does not, ask a TA for asissistance.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <h1 class="text-2xl text-bold underline text-cs-green">Step 2</h1>
                <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">
                    Here, you need to edit the code using Nano to make it more personal. To do this, change the string at the bottom of "HelloWorld.s" (Not "HelloWorld" or "HelloWorld.o") to "Hello [Your Name Here]!". Remember that the red pitaya needs to know how many characters to write on the screen, so you will need to update the line <code class="bg-cs-blue px-1 rounded shadow-lg text-base">mov R2, #13   @ length of our string</code> to the new length of the string. Remember to include spaces, special characters, and the "\n" as a single character when counting.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">
                    To check that your program works, you will need to run it again. It is important to note that you must recompile your code <u>every time you make a change</u>. You can recompile using the command <code class="bg-cs-blue px-1 rounded shadow-lg text-base">./build</code>. Run your program again using <code class="bg-cs-blue px-1 rounded shadow-lg text-base">./HelloWorld</code>, which should output "Hello [Your Name]!"into the terminal. <u>Take a screenshot of the output, as well as your code, and make sure to include it in your lab report.</u>
                </p>
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <h1 class="text-2xl text-bold underline text-cs-green">Step 3</h1>
                <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">
                    This next step is pretty simple. Go into HelloWorld.s and change the LAST <code class="bg-cs-blue px-1 rounded shadow-lg text-base">svc 0</code> to <code class="bg-cs-blue px-1 rounded shadow-lg text-base">svc AnyOtherNumber</code>. Where "AnyOtherNumber" is a number other than 0. Recompile your code and rerun it. What happened? <u>Take a screenshot of the output and write out what you saw happen in your own words.</u> If nothing happened, take note of that as well.

# Overview
If you have never worked with the Command Line before, it can seem very daunting at first. Even if you have been coding for years, your first experience with the Command Line can be a shocking reality check into just how deep the CS Iceberg goes.

Right now, everything may seem like a jumble of letters, commands, and confusing sequences, but the Command Line is made to be logical. You don't need to memorize everything. In fact, **you will only need to know about 5-6 commands to be successful in most classes.** Any additional commands will probably need to be looked up in the moment, as many have very specific input parameters.

# Terminology
Before we dive into the exact commands, it is important to know what the Command Line is, and how it differs from the Terminal, Shell, and Console.

Most people use these four terms interchangeably. And, to be fair, they are very similar. If you confuse them, don't worry, people will still know what you are talking about, and they all refer to the same thing. So here is the layman definitions of these interfaces:
### Console
The console was originally the only way to access a computer. It refers to the physical components that let you interact with the device. Technically, your keyboard and mouse are part of the console, since you use them to interact with your screen. Nowadays, people usually refer to the console like a Terminal or a way for the computer to show you information (like the console in VSCode).
### Terminal
The terminal is an app on your computer that gives you access to the Shell. All computers have a Terminal app installed by default.
### Shell
The shell is the actual computer part of the console. It is what reads, processes, and executes commands. It is generally considered the "core" of the console/terminal/command-line system.
### Command Line / CLI
The Command Line, or CLI (for Command Line Interface) is the place in the shell where you input commands. It generally has the character `>` or `$` preceding it to show where to type, as well as listing the current directory. You will often hear that a piece of software has "Command Line Interface/CLI", which just means you can interact with the app through the command line.
### WSL (Windows Subsystem Linux)
Most popular commands originally stem from the Linux operating system. Mac uses these commands, which simplifies the Terminal quite a bit. However, Windows computers don't use these same commands (besides a few of the most basic ones, including the ones below). Thus, to streamline the process, it is highly suggested that you download [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install). This is a new terminal for your computer that runs on a Linux system so you can use all the native Linux commands. When you want to use it, be sure to launch the "WSL" app and not the "PowerShell" or "Terminal" apps.


# Entering the Terminal
So, now that you know what the Command Line is, let's move on to how to use it. 

For the first interactive part of this lab, go ahead and open up `Terminal` if you are on Mac, or `Windows PowerShell` if you are on Windows. These come preinstalled on your computer, and they can be found with the search bar.

You should see a line that looks like this if you are on Windows (it will look similarly, but not exactly the same on Mac):

```
C:\Users\YourName>
```

where `YourName` is the name of your computer.

This line is called the "prompt." It will show up before every line that you type (sometimes it will show different text, and that's okay! It just means you are in a different place). If the command line does not have a prompt, then that means it is loading or processing a big command. Give it a few seconds and it should pop up again.

# Viewing Directories and Files
When you open up the command line, you are placed in something called a **directory**. <u>A directory is just a fancy name for a folder.</u> You usually start in the Home directory, which you can find on your computer in the File Explorer (or Finder on Mac). The home directory is the base folder your computer uses as reference. It is the directory your computer opens when first opening the Command Line. 

## Viewing Directories

To see what directory you are in, type out `pwd` and click Enter.

---
### Command
`pwd` — Displays the name of the current directory. It stands for Print Working Directory.

---

Congratulations! You just executed your first Linux command! You should see something that looks like this (may look slightly different for Mac):
```
PS C:\Users\YourName> pwd

Path
----
C:\Users\YourName


PS C:\Users\YourName>
```
If you get a red error message instead, don't worry. Odds are you are just using a command line without Linux commands installed. If you are on Windows, make sure you are in POWERSHELL, not TERMINAL. If that still doesn't work, check out the [WSL (Windows Subsystem Linux)](#wsl-windows-subsystem-linux) section for more info.

So, what just happened? Basically, you used the Command Line to tell the computer that you wanted the name of your current directory/folder. The computer processed your request (the `pwd` command), and printed out the result. Then, it opened up the command line again and waited for a new command (which is why you see the C:\\\\ line at the bottom). 

## Viewing Files
Now, let's see what is inside the current directory (you can always check what the "current directory" is using the `pwd` command). To list the files in the current directory, use the `ls` command.

---
### Command
`ls` — Displays the contents of the current directory. It is short for "LiSt" (as in "list" the files).

---

You should see something like this (may vary slightly on Mac):

```
Mode                 LastWriteTime         Length Name
\----                 -------------         ------ ----
d-r---          3/2/2023   6:49 PM                Contacts
d-r---         1/31/2024  12:26 AM                Desktop
d-r---         1/24/2024   8:59 PM                Documents
d-r---         2/11/2024   6:19 PM                Downloads
d-r---          3/2/2023   6:49 PM                Favorites
```

(But yours will likely include many more files)

The `ls` command is going to be your favorite and most used command from now on. It will help you navigate through directories, find out where you are, and display useful information about files.

Here are some important things to note about using `ls`. If you are using `Windows PowerShell` and not `WSL`, then some of these next notes won't apply to you. I highly suggest making the switch so you can practice seeing these things. Here are some important notes about how `ls` displays files with color coding:
- Blue — Directory
- White/Black — Code file
- Green — Executable

## Changing Directories

Odds are, when you used the `ls` command in your home directory, your `Downloads` file was displayed in blue text. That means that `Downloads` is a directory! Just like the home directory, you can enter the `Downloads` directory and see what's inside. To do that, we use the command `cd`.

---
### Command
`cd fileName` — Changes the directory that you are in. It stands for "Change Directory."

---

There is something different about the `cd` command. Instead of just typing the command, you have to add something else to the line. This other part is called an "argument" (you may recognize the term if you are familiar with functions in coding). An argument is a value that you give to the command to tell it what to do. In this case, you are giving the `cd` command the argument `fileName`, where `fileName` is the name of the directory you want to go to.

So, if you want to go to the `Downloads` folder, you would type the command:
```bash
cd Downloads
```
If it worked correctly, some things should change. First, the prompt should change from
`C:\Users\YourName`
to
`C:\Users\YourName\Downloads`

Another thing you should notice is that nothing is outputted after you enter the command. That's okay. Not all commands print out responses, but if it doesn't give you a big red error, then odds are that it worked. However, to make sure, try printing out the name of the directory. Do you remember what the command to print the name of the directory is? (Hint: it's the first one you learned).

Two important things to note:
1. You can only `cd` into directories (always listed in blue). If you try to `cd` into a code file, you will get an error.
2. If you type out the first couple letters of the file name and click `Tab`, then the Commands Line will autofill the rest of the file name. How handy! This will help you avoid making typos and speed up the process, especially for long fine names. (One thing to note is that if multiple files have the same few letters, you can keep hitting `Tab` to cycle through all of your options).

Now that you are in the `Downloads` directory, try listing out the files. Do you remember the command? (Hint: it is the second one we learned). You should get an output similar to the first example, but this time, it only lists files in the Downloads file on your computer. You can actually check this by going to File Explorer (Windows) or Finder (Mac) and comparing your results. They may not be in the same order, but you should see all the files listed there!

# Creating Directories and Files
## Creating Directories
Since we now know how to go into a directory, let's learn how to make our own. The command for creating your own directory is `mkdir directoryName`, where directoryName is what you want to call the new directory. You can call it whatever you like (or just `FirstNameLastName` for simplicity).

---
### Command
`mkdir directoryName` — Creates a directory inside the current directory. It stands for "MaKe DIRectory."

---

If you list out the files again, you should see your new, shiny blue directory among the list. Congrats! It's your very own directory. There are many like it, but this one is yours. Now, go ahead and enter into your new directory. Do you remember the command? (Hint: it is the third one we learned).


## Creating Files
Now that you're inside your new directory, try listing out the files using the command we learned. You should notice something strange: nothing gets displayed. That's because when we create a directory, it starts off empty. How sad! Let's make a file to fill our new directory. The command to make a new file is `touch fileName`, where fileName is the name of the file we want to create (including the extension, aka: .s .py .txt .mp3 etc). You can call it whatever you like (or just `myFile.txt` for simplicity).

---
### Command
`touch fileName` — Creates a code file inside the current directory. Think about it as "putting your fingerprints on a new file."

---

Beautiful! Go ahead and list the contents one more time to make sure your new file is in there (it should be in White text. If it's blue, you made a directory by mistake! Make sure to use `touch` and not `mkdir`).

## Leaving Directories
Now that you've finished making your own directory and file, let's learn how to go back up into the `Downloads` directory. If you try to use `cd Downloads`, you will see that you get an error. That's because `Downloads` is the "parent" directory. Think of it as a set of Russian Nesting Dolls, with each directory inside of each other. Each doll/directory can only see what is inside of itself, not what's above it (the "parent" doll if you will). So, to go "up" a directory, we need a special command: `cd ..` (that's two periods, to be clear)

---
### Command
`cd ..` — Go "up" one directory (to the parent directory). `..` always stands for the parent of a directory.

---

You should be back in `Downloads`! Try using the command again to get back to your Home directory (`C:\Users\YourName`). 

# Conclusion
Congratulations! You just learned all of the basic Linux commands you will need for this course! There are a few more that you will learn later on (including `ssh`), but these are the main ones and the ones you should know by heart. I'll leave you with just one more command, but this one is just for aesthetics. Entering `clear` will clear the terminal, leaving it nice and sparkly! Don't worry, this doesn't change which directory you are in, and it doesn't mess with your files. It just removes the clutter from the screen.

---
### Command
`clear` — Clear the old commands on the terminal screen. Useful to hide error messages and remove clutter.

---

That should be it for this section of Lab 0. But before you move on to the next section, check the `Downloads` folder of your computer using Finder or File Explorer. See if you can find the directory and file that you made. Now you can see how to use the Command Line to affect real files on your computer!

# What's Next?
Want to start putting your Command Line knowledge to good use? One of my favorite resources is [OverTheWire](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/), which is a game built around using the terminal. Though it is mainly used to train Red Team Cybersecurity hackers, the beginner stages are a great intro to the terminal. 

I suggest working your way through at least level 8 to start feeling comfortable writing commands. You will start out with `ssh`, which lets you connect to computers other than your own. Each level has some handy resources with commands you might need. 

The point of the game is finding information on your own like a real coder. This means Googling for information, testing things that may not work, and finding out how to use commands in practice. Though we encourage you to try and find solutions on your own, there are plenty of people who are able to help you and will work through it with you step by step!
