                    If you have never worked with the Command Line before, it can seem very daunting at first. Even if you have been coding for years, your first experience with the Command Line can be a shocking reality check into just how deep the CS Iceberg goes.

                <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">
                    Right now, everything may seem like a jumble of letters, commands, and confusing sequences, but the Command Line is made to be logical. You don't need to memorize everything. In fact, **you will only need to know about 5-6 commands to be successful in most classes.** Any additional commands will probably need to be looked up in the moment, as many have very specific input parameters.

                    Before we dive into the exact commands, it is important to know what the Command Line is, and how it differs from the Terminal, Shell, and Console.
                </p>
                <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">
                    Most people use these four terms interchangeably. And, to be fair, they are very similar. If you confuse them, don't worry, people will still know what you are talking about, and they all refer to the same thing. So here is the layman definitions of these interfaces:
                </p>
                <br/>
                <ol class="list ml-6 text-lg">
                    <b class="text-cs-green">Console:</b> <li>The console was originally the only way to access a computer. It refers to the physical components that let you interact with the device. Technically, your keyboard and mouse are part of the console, since you use them to interact with your screen. Nowadays, people usually refer to the console like a Terminal or a way for the computer to show you information (like the console in VSCode).</li>
                    <br/><b class="text-cs-green">Terminal:</b> <li>The terminal is an app on your computer that gives you access to the Shell. All computers have a Terminal app installed by default.</li>
                    <br/><b class="text-cs-green">Shell:</b> <li>The shell is the actual computer part of the console. It is what reads, processes, and executes commands. It is generally considered the "core" of the console/terminal/command-line system.</li>
                    <br/><b class="text-cs-green">Command Line/CLI:</b> <li>The Command Line, or CLI (for Command Line Interface) is the place in the shell where you input commands. It generally has the character `>` or `$` preceding it to show where to type, as well as listing the current directory. You will often hear that a piece of software has "Command Line Interface/CLI", which just means you can interact with the app through the command line.</li>
                    <br/><b class="text-cs-green">WSL:</b> <li>Most popular commands originally stem from the Linux operating system. Mac uses these commands, which simplifies the Terminal quite a bit. However, Windows computers don't use these same commands (besides a few of the most basic ones, including the ones below). Thus, to streamline the process, it is highly suggested that you download <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install" class="text-lg text-cs-blue hover:text-blue-700 underline">WSL here</a>. This is a new terminal for your computer that runs on a Linux system so you can use all the native Linux commands. When you want to use it, be sure to launch the "WSL" app and not the "PowerShell" or "Terminal" apps.</li>

                <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">
                    So, now that you know what the Command Line is, let's move on to how to use it.</p>
                <br/>
                <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">
                    For the first interactive part of this lab, go ahead and open up `Terminal` if you are on Mac, or `Windows PowerShell` if you are on Windows. These come preinstalled on your computer, and they can be found with the search bar.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">
                    You should see a line that looks like this if you are on Windows (it will look similarly, but not exactly the same on Mac):
                </p>
                <br/>
                <pre class="dark:bg-gray-600 bg-gray-400 rounded-lg p-4 shadow-2xl overflow-auto">

                <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">
                    where YourName is the name of your computer.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">
                    This line is called the "prompt." It will show up before every line that you type (sometimes it will show different text, and that's okay! It just means you are in a different place). If the command line does not have a prompt, then that means it is loading or processing a big command. Give it a few seconds and it should pop up again. To cancel a process that is loading too long, use Control+C (it is Control+C on Mac too, not Command).
                </p>

                <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">
                    When you open up the command line, you are placed in something called a <b>directory</b>. <u>A directory is just a fancy name for a folder.</u> You usually start in the Home directory, which you can find on your computer in the File Explorer (or Finder on Mac). The home directory is the base folder your computer uses as reference. It is the directory your computer opens when first opening the Command Line.

                    If you get a red error message instead, don't worry. Odds are you are just using a command line without Linux commands installed. If you are on Windows, make sure you are in POWERSHELL, not TERMINAL. If that still doesn't work, check out the WSL (Windows Subsystem Linux) description in the <a href="#terminology" class="text-lg text-cs-blue hover:text-blue-700 underline">Terminology</a> section for more info.

                <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">
                    So, what just happened? Basically, you used the Command Line to tell the computer that you wanted the name of your current directory/folder. The computer processed your request (the <code class="bg-cs-blue px-1 rounded shadow-lg text-base">pwd</code> command), and printed out the result. Then, it opened up the command line again and waited for a new command (which is why you see the PS C:\Users\YourName> line at the bottom). 
                </p>
                <br/>

                <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">
                    Now, let's see what is inside the current directory (you can always check what the "current directory" is using the <code class="bg-cs-blue px-1 rounded shadow-lg text-base">pwd</code> command). To list the files in the current directory, use the <code class="bg-cs-blue px-1 rounded shadow-lg text-base">ls</code> command.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">
                    <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-cs-blue italic pl-4 text-cs-green text-xl">
                        ls â€” Displays the contents of the current directory. It is short for "LiSt" (as in "list" the files).

                </p>
                <br/>
                <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">
                    On Mac/WSL, you will just see a list of folders and files in the current directory. On Windows, it will be the same, but formatted like this:

                <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">
                    Odds are, when you used the <code class="bg-cs-blue px-1 rounded shadow-lg text-base">ls</code> command in your home directory, your Downloads file was displayed in blue text. That means that 'Downloads' is a directory! Just like the home directory, you can enter the 'Downloads' directory and see what's inside. To do that, we use the command <code class="bg-cs-blue px-1 rounded shadow-lg text-base">cd</code>.
                </p>

                <br/>
                <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">
                    There is something different about the <code class="bg-cs-blue px-1 rounded shadow-lg text-base">cd</code> command. Instead of just typing the command, you have to add something else to the line. This other part is called an "argument" (you may recognize the term if you are familiar with functions in coding). An argument is a value that you give to the command to tell it what to do. In this case, you are giving the <code class="bg-cs-blue px-1 rounded shadow-lg text-base">cd</code> command the argument 'fileName', where 'fileName' is the name of the directory you want to go to.
                </p>

                <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">
                    So, if you want to go to the `Downloads` folder, you would type the command:

                <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">
                    If it worked correctly, some things should change. First, the prompt should change from

                <br/>
                <pre class="dark:bg-gray-600 bg-gray-400 rounded-lg p-4 shadow-2xl overflow-auto">

                <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">
                    Another thing you should notice is that nothing is outputted after you enter the command. That's okay. Not all commands print out responses, but if it doesn't give you a big red error, then odds are that it worked. However, to make sure, try printing out the name of the directory. Do you remember what the command to print the name of the directory is? (Hint: it's the first one you learned).

                <ol class="list-decimal ml-6 text-lg">

                    <li>If you type out the first couple letters of the file name and click Tab, then the Commands Line will autofill the rest of the file name. This will help you avoid making typos and speed up the process, especially for long file names.

You should get an output similar to the first example, but this time, it only lists files in the Downloads file on your computer. You can actually check this by going to File Explorer (Windows) or Finder (Mac) and comparing your results. They may not be in the same order, but you should see all the files listed there!

The command to make a new file is <code class="bg-cs-blue px-1 rounded shadow-lg text-base">touch fileName</code>, where fileName is the name of the file we want to create (including the extension, aka: .s .py .txt .mp3 etc).

It may take a minute to settle into these concepts, but know that there are plenty of resources available to you if you are confused. See either Dr. Camp's office hours or preferably the TA office hours for help with labs, homework, or general questions about the course.

Beautiful! Go ahead and list the contents one more time to make sure your new file is in there (it should be in White text. If it's blue, you made a directory by mistake! Make sure to use `touch` and not `mkdir`).

## Leaving Directories
Now that you've finished making your own directory and file, let's learn how to go back up into the `Downloads` directory. If you try to use `cd Downloads`, you will see that you get an error. That's because `Downloads` is the "parent" directory. Think of it as a set of Russian Nesting Dolls, with each directory inside of each other. Each doll/directory can only see what is inside of itself, not what's above it (the "parent" doll if you will). So, to go "up" a directory, we need a special command: `cd ..` (that's two periods, to be clear)

---
### Command
`cd ..` â€” Go "up" one directory (to the parent directory). `..` always stands for the parent of a directory.

---

You should be back in `Downloads`! Try using the command again to get back to your Home directory (`C:\Users\YourName`). 

# Conclusion
Congratulations! You just learned all of the basic Linux commands you will need for this course! There are a few more that you will learn later on (including `ssh`), but these are the main ones and the ones you should know by heart. I'll leave you with just one more command, but this one is just for aesthetics. Entering `clear` will clear the terminal, leaving it nice and sparkly! Don't worry, this doesn't change which directory you are in, and it doesn't mess with your files. It just removes the clutter from the screen.

---
### Command
`clear` â€” Clear the old commands on the terminal screen. Useful to hide error messages and remove clutter.

---

That should be it for this section of Lab 0. But before you move on to the next section, check the `Downloads` folder of your computer using Finder or File Explorer. See if you can find the directory and file that you made. Now you can see how to use the Command Line to affect real files on your computer!

# What's Next?
Want to start putting your Command Line knowledge to good use? One of my favorite resources is [OverTheWire](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/), which is a game built around using the terminal. Though it is mainly used to train Red Team Cybersecurity hackers, the beginner stages are a great intro to the terminal. 

I suggest working your way through at least level 8 to start feeling comfortable writing commands. You will start out with `ssh`, which lets you connect to computers other than your own. Each level has some handy resources with commands you might need. 

The point of the game is finding information on your own like a real coder. This means Googling for information, testing things that may not work, and finding out how to use commands in practice. Though we encourage you to try and find solutions on your own, there are plenty of people who are able to help you and will work through it with you step by step!
